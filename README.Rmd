# cumulative-incidence

The goal of the cumulative-incidence project is to provide a tutorial for JHS-HWG members who want to create cumulative incidence plots using `ggplot2`. To demonstrate the code in this repository, we use the `flchain` data from the `survival` package. These data are loaded and printed here.

```{r load-and-print-flchain, message = FALSE}

library(survival)
library(tidyverse)

glimpse(flchain)

```

# Create cumulative incidence data

The `cuminc()` function in the `cmprsk` package can generate data on the cumulative incidence of a censored outcome, accounting for competing risks if necessary.

```{r}

library(cmprsk)

cml_inc = cuminc(
 # explain
 ftime   = flchain$futime, 
 # explain
 fstatus = flchain$death,
 # explain
 group   = flchain$creatinine > 1
)

```
