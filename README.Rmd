# cumulative-incidence

The goal of the cumulative-incidence project is to provide a tutorial for JHS-HWG members who want to create cumulative incidence plots using `ggplot2`. To demonstrate the code in this repository, we use the `flchain` data from the `survival` package. These data are loaded and printed here.

```{r load-and-print-flchain, message = FALSE}

library(survival)
library(tidyverse)

glimpse(flchain)

```
